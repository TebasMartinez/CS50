## Notes from lecture

Compilers turn code into 0s and 01s \
When we are using make- in the terminal we're using a compilar \
A common compiler is _clang_, but it names programs 'a.out' by default \
So if we use
> clang hello.c

we get a program named \
> a.out 

### Arguments
Arguments are inputs to a program. Clang supports additional arguments at command line, so we can name out programs. \
So if we use
> clang -o hello hello.c

we get \
> hello
